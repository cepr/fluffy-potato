When starting the car, the lighting is set to low beam.

Pulling the handle will cause a headlight flash (both low and high beam on). If releasing before 1 second, the lighting goes back to its previous setting. If releasing after 1 second, the lighting will toggle between low and high beam.

`LIGHTS` bit 0: low beam bulbs
`LIGHTS` bit 1: high beam bulbs
